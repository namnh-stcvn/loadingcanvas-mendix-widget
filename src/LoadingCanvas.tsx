 * In a Mendix project, this file is the build entry point.

 * The LoadingCanvasContainer is the Mendix-facing component that:
 * - Receives props from Mendix (object references, canvas dimensions, callbacks)
 * - Resolves object references via mx.data API
 * - Converts them to view models using adapters
 * - Passes view models to the LoadingCanvas widget
